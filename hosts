# Ansible ad-hoc commands are a fast way to interact with desired servers:
# ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"
# ansible all -i hosts -m ping  : ping  all targets from inventory list "hosts"
# ansible webservers -i hosts -m ping  : ping  only webservers targets from inventory list "hosts"
# ansible 10.24.0.8  -i hosts -m ping  : ping  specific target
